# s2-freecam
A proof of concept demonstrating using agl's built-in debug free camera in Splatoon 2. Knowledge here is roughly transferable to any game that uses agl and also uses `agl::lyr::Renderer` for rendering.

# Note
This project is a proof of concept. No support will be provided.
Also, this will trigger Splatoon 2's code integrity checking and so proper precautions should be used.
